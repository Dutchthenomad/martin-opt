## 🧮 RISK CALCULATION FORMULAS

### Duration Risk
- **Expanded Dataset**: `duration_risk = 1 - (duration_ticks / 1000)`
- **Player-Integrated Dataset**: `duration_risk = max(0, 1 - (duration_ticks / 500))`
- Higher values indicate shorter, riskier games

### Composite Risk Score
- **Expanded Dataset**: 
  ```
  composite_risk = (0.4 × duration_risk) + (0.3 × multiplier_risk) + (0.3 × volume_risk)
  ```
- **Player-Integrated Dataset**: 
  ```
  composite_risk = (0.4 × duration_risk) + (0.3 × concentration_risk) + (0.3 × activity_risk)
  ```

## 🎯 BAYESIAN APPLICATIONS

### Primary Risk Factors
1. **Duration Risk**: Probability distributions based on `duration_ticks`
2. **Peak Risk**: Likelihood functions using `peak_multiplier`
3. **Concentration Risk**: Player dominance via `top_player_volume_ratio`
4. **Activity Risk**: Trading intensity patterns

### Multi-Factor Models
Combine multiple data points:
- Duration + Peak + Volume patterns
- Player concentration + Trading velocity
- Price volatility + Timing irregularities
- Entry timing + Player experience levels

### Key Probability Calculations

**Survival Probability to Tick N**:
```
P(survive to N) = COUNT(duration_ticks ≥ N) / COUNT(all games)
```

**Expected Multiplier at Tick N**:
```
E[multiplier | tick ≥ N] = AVERAGE(peak_multiplier WHERE duration_ticks ≥ N)
```

**Conditional Instarug Risk**:
```
P(instarug | current_tick < 10) = COUNT(instarugs) / COUNT(games ending < 10 ticks)
```
