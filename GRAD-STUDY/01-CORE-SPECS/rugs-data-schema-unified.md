## üßÆ RISK CALCULATION FORMULAS

### Duration Risk
- **Expanded Dataset**: `duration_risk = 1 - (duration_ticks / 1000)`
- **Player-Integrated Dataset**: `duration_risk = max(0, 1 - (duration_ticks / 500))`
- Higher values indicate shorter, riskier games

### Composite Risk Score
- **Expanded Dataset**: 
  ```
  composite_risk = (0.4 √ó duration_risk) + (0.3 √ó multiplier_risk) + (0.3 √ó volume_risk)
  ```
- **Player-Integrated Dataset**: 
  ```
  composite_risk = (0.4 √ó duration_risk) + (0.3 √ó concentration_risk) + (0.3 √ó activity_risk)
  ```

## üìä ADVANCED DATA STRUCTURES

```
priceProgression[]: {
  tick: Number,      // Tick number
  price: Number,     // Price at tick
  timestamp: String  // ISO timestamp
}
```

### Player Activity Object
Detailed per-player trading data:
```
playerActivity[playerId]: {
  trades: Number,    // Trade count
  volume: Number     // Total volume
}
```

## üìà STATISTICAL INSIGHTS

### Duration Distribution (Last 100 Games)
- **Mean**: 210.2 ticks
- **Median**: 147.5 ticks
- **Range**: 2-1334 ticks
- **Distribution**: Right-skewed with long tail

### Peak Multiplier Distribution
- **Mean**: 4.17x
- **Median**: 1.84x
- **Range**: 1.00x-53.41x
- **Distribution**: Heavily right-skewed

### Instarug Statistics
- **Rate**: 8.0% (8/100 games)
- **Definition**: Games ending within first 10 ticks
- **Risk Window**: Critical first 10 ticks

---

## üéØ BAYESIAN APPLICATIONS

### Primary Risk Factors
1. **Duration Risk**: Probability distributions based on `duration_ticks`
2. **Peak Risk**: Likelihood functions using `peak_multiplier`
3. **Concentration Risk**: Player dominance via `top_player_volume_ratio`
4. **Activity Risk**: Trading intensity patterns

### Multi-Factor Models
Combine multiple data points:
- Duration + Peak + Volume patterns
- Player concentration + Trading velocity
- Price volatility + Timing irregularities
- Entry timing + Player experience levels

### Key Probability Calculations

**Survival Probability to Tick N**:
```
P(survive to N) = COUNT(duration_ticks ‚â• N) / COUNT(all games)
```

**Expected Multiplier at Tick N**:
```
E[multiplier | tick ‚â• N] = AVERAGE(peak_multiplier WHERE duration_ticks ‚â• N)
```

**Conditional Instarug Risk**:
```
P(instarug | current_tick < 10) = COUNT(instarugs) / COUNT(games ending < 10 ticks)
```
