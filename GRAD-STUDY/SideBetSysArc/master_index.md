# Rugs.fun Side Betting System - Master Documentation Index

## Project Overview
This documentation family provides comprehensive coverage of the Rugs.fun side betting decision support system, from basic mechanics to advanced predictive algorithms. Each document builds upon previous knowledge to create a complete understanding of the system.

## Critical Timing Analysis Update (July 2025)
**IMPORTANT**: Comprehensive analysis of 100 games (22,507 tick intervals) reveals:
- **Mean tick timing**: 271.5ms (8.6% above theoretical 250ms)
- **Median tick timing**: 251.0ms (remarkably close to theoretical)
- **95% of ticks**: Fall between 237-269ms
- **High variance**: Coefficient of variation 1.09 requires adaptive models
This empirical data provides the foundation for accurate probability calculations and strategy implementations.

## üîÑ Version Control
- **Current Version**: 2.0
- **Last Updated**: July 24, 2025
- **Critical Changes**: Updated with empirical timing analysis from 100 games (22,507 tick intervals)
- **Key Update**: Corrected timing data - mean: 271.5ms, median: 251ms (not 558.6ms)

## üìà Key Performance Indicators
- **System Accuracy**: Target >85% prediction accuracy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Notes
1. **Timing Variance**: All calculations must account for 271.5ms mean tick time (251ms median)
2. **Gap Risk**: Variable cooldown periods create additional risk factors
3. **Cloudflare Bypass**: Automation requires Puppeteer for reliable execution
4. **Real-time Requirements**: System must adapt to changing server conditions
5. **Mathematical Precision**: All financial calculations require 6+ decimal precision
