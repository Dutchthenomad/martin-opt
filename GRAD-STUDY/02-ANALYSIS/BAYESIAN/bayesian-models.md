# 🧮 BAYESIAN MATHEMATICAL MODELS FOR PRNG ANALYSIS

**Mathematical foundation for probability calculations and risk assessment**

---

## 🎯 CORE BAYESIAN THEOREM

### Bayes' Formula for PRNG Analysis
```
P(outcome | evidence) = P(evidence | outcome) × P(outcome) / P(evidence)
```

**Applied to PRNG:**
```
P(rug at tick t | current state) = P(current state | rug at tick t) × P(rug at tick t) / P(current state)
```

## 📊 BASIC SURVIVAL MODELS

### 1. Simple Survival Probability
**Question**: What's the probability a game survives to tick N?

**Formula**:
```
P(survive to tick N) = Count(games with finalTick ≥ N) / Total games
```

**Google Sheets Implementation**:
```excel
=COUNTIF(B:B,">="&N)/COUNT(B:B)
```
*Where B:B contains duration_ticks data*

### 2. Expected Multiplier at Tick N
**Question**: If a game reaches tick N, what's the expected peak multiplier?

**Formula**:
```
E[multiplier | tick ≥ N] = Σ(multiplier × P(multiplier | tick ≥ N))
```

**Google Sheets Implementation**:
```excel
=AVERAGEIF(B:B,">="&N,C:C)
```
*Where C:C contains peak_multiplier data*

### 3. Instarug Probability
**Question**: What's the baseline probability of an instarug?

**Formula**:
```
P(instarug) = Count(games with finalTick < 11) / Total games
```

**Google Sheets Implementation**:
```excel
=COUNTIF(G:G,TRUE)/COUNT(G:G)
```
*Where G:G contains is_instarug boolean data*

## 🎲 CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY MODELS

### 1. Risk Given Peak Multiplier
**Question**: What's the rug risk if peak multiplier exceeds X?

**Formula**:
```
P(rug soon | peak > X) = Count(games with peak > X and short duration) / Count(games with peak > X)
```

**Google Sheets Implementation**:
```excel
=COUNTIFS(C:C,">"&X,B:B,"<"&THRESHOLD)/COUNTIF(C:C,">"&X)
```

### 2. Survival Given Current Tick
**Question**: If we're at tick T, what's the probability of reaching tick T+N?

**Formula**:
```
P(reach T+N | at T) = Count(games ≥ T+N) / Count(games ≥ T)
```

**Google Sheets Implementation**:
```excel
=COUNTIF(B:B,">="&(T+N))/COUNTIF(B:B,">="&T)
```

## 📈 ADVANCED MULTI-FACTOR MODELS

### 1. Weighted Risk Score
**Combines multiple risk factors**

**Formula**:
```
Risk Score = w₁×Duration_Factor + w₂×Multiplier_Factor + w₃×Volume_Factor
```

**Where factors are normalized (0-1) and weights sum to 1**

**Example Implementation**:
```
Duration_Factor = 1 - (current_tick / max_observed_ticks)
Multiplier_Factor = current_peak / max_observed_peak
Volume_Factor = recent_volume / average_volume
```

### 2. Bayesian Update Model
**Updates probability as new evidence arrives**

**Formula**:
```
P(rug | new_evidence) = P(new_evidence | rug) × P(rug) / P(new_evidence)
```

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Start with prior probability P(rug)
2. Observe new evidence (price movement, volume, etc.)
3. Calculate likelihood P(evidence | rug)
4. Update posterior probability

## 🎯 PRACTICAL CALCULATIONS

### 1. Expected Value Calculation
**Question**: What's the expected return if I exit at tick N?

**Formula**:
```
E[return] = P(survive to N) × multiplier_at_N × bet - bet
```

**Google Sheets Implementation**:
```excel
=(COUNTIF(B:B,">="&N)/COUNT(B:B)) * AVERAGEIF(B:B,">="&N,D:D) * bet_amount - bet_amount
```

### 2. Optimal Exit Point
**Find tick that maximizes expected value**

**Method**: Calculate expected value for each potential exit tick and find maximum

### 3. Risk-Adjusted Return
**Account for risk tolerance**

**Formula**:
```
Risk_Adjusted_Return = Expected_Return - (Risk_Penalty × Variance)
```

---

## 📊 CONFIDENCE INTERVALS

### 1. Survival Probability Confidence
**95% confidence interval for survival probability**

**Formula**:
```
CI = p ± 1.96 × √(p×(1-p)/n)
```
*Where p = survival probability, n = sample size*

### 2. Expected Multiplier Confidence
**Confidence interval for expected multiplier**

**Formula**:
```
CI = μ ± 1.96 × (σ/√n)
```
*Where μ = mean multiplier, σ = standard deviation*

## 🔄 DYNAMIC UPDATING

### 1. Real-Time Probability Updates
**Update survival probability as game progresses**

**Current Survival Rate**: 
```excel
=COUNTIF(B:B,">="&CURRENT_TICK)/COUNT(B:B)
```

**Next Tick Survival**:
```excel
=COUNTIF(B:B,">="&(CURRENT_TICK+1))/COUNTIF(B:B,">="&CURRENT_TICK)
```

### 2. Momentum Indicators
**Track probability changes**

**Acceleration Risk**:
```
Risk_Change = P(rug | current_tick) - P(rug | current_tick-1)
```

## 🎮 GAME-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS

### 1. Entry Point Analysis
**Best tick to enter based on risk/reward**

**Formula**:
```
Entry_Score = Expected_Multiplier × Survival_Probability - Entry_Risk
```

### 2. Portfolio Risk Management
**Multiple games risk assessment**

**Formula**:
```
Portfolio_Risk = 1 - Π(1 - Individual_Game_Risk)
```

### 3. Bankroll Management
**Optimal bet sizing**

**Kelly Criterion Application**:
```
Optimal_Bet = (bp - q) / b
```
*Where b = odds, p = win probability, q = loss probability*
