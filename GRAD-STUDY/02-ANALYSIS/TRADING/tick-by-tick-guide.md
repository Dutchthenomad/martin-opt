## üßÆ CRITICAL ANALYSIS FORMULAS

### Rug Proximity Analysis

**Volatility spike detection:**
```excel
=AVERAGEIF(G:G,TRUE,N:N) / AVERAGEIF(G:G,FALSE,N:N)
```

**Trading activity before rug:**
```excel
=AVERAGEIFS(Q:Q,F:F,"<=5") / AVERAGEIFS(Q:Q,F:F,">20")
```

### Price Movement Patterns

**Pre-rug price velocity:**
```excel
=AVERAGEIFS(M:M,G:G,TRUE)
```

**Price change acceleration near rug:**
```excel
=AVERAGEIFS(L:L,F:F,"<=3")
```

### Player Behavior Analysis

**Panic selling detection:**
```excel
=SUMIFS(R:R,F:F,"<=5") / SUMIFS(Q:Q,F:F,"<=5")
```

**Player exodus timing:**
```excel
=AVERAGEIFS(T:T,E:E,">0.8") - AVERAGEIFS(T:T,E:E,"<0.2")
```

## üìä GOOGLE SHEETS ANALYSIS SETUP

### 1. Volatility Warning System

**Create volatility threshold alerts:**
```excel
=IF(N2>AVERAGE(N:N)*1.5,"HIGH_VOLATILITY","NORMAL")
```

**Rolling volatility trend:**
```excel
=AVERAGE(OFFSET(N2,-10,0,10,1))
```

### 2. Rug Prediction Model

**Combine volatility + trading activity:**
```excel
=IF(AND(N2>0.3, U2<0.5, F2<=10), "RUG_WARNING", "SAFE")
```

**Multi-factor rug risk score:**
```excel
=MIN(1, (N2*0.4 + (1-U2)*0.3 + ABS(X2)*0.3))
```

### 3. Player Behavior Tracking

**Activity heat map by tick position:**
```excel
=SUMIFS(T:T, E:E, ">="&ROW()/100-0.05, E:E, "<"&ROW()/100+0.05)
```

**Trading pattern analysis:**
```excel
=CORREL(E:E, T:T)  # Player activity vs game progression
```

2. **Buy/Sell ratio < 0.5** (heavy selling)
3. **Player exodus** (active players dropping)
4. **Timing irregularities** (interval deviations > 1.0)

### Rug Prediction Formula
```excel
=IF(AND(rolling_volatility>0.3, buy_sell_ratio<0.5, players_active<3), "IMMINENT_RUG", 
   IF(AND(rolling_volatility>0.2, ticks_to_rug<=10), "HIGH_RISK",
   "NORMAL"))
```
