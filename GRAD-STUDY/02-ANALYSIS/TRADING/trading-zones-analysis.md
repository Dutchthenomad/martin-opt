## Optimal Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Balanced Range Trading (3.2x → 4.8x)
This strategy targets the most favorable risk-reward zone in the game.

- **Entry Point**: 3.2x
  - Located in the balanced trading zone
  - Volatility around 0.9%
  - Moderate momentum but before high-risk territory

- **Exit Point**: 4.8x
  - 50% gain from entry
  - Still within reasonable risk zone
  - Higher volatility signals increased risk

- **Stop Loss**: 2.8x
  - 12.5% loss from entry
  - Near bottom of balanced zone
  - Risk-reward ratio of 1:4 (risk 12.5% to gain 50%)

- **Expected Success Rate**: ~65%
  - Based on average time to rug vs time to reach target
  - Accounts for volatility and historical game patterns

### Strategy 2: Growth Zone Scalping (8.5x → 14x)
A higher risk strategy with larger potential rewards.

- **Entry Point**: 8.5x
  - Enter on a local dip in the growth zone
  - Volatility around 1.46%
  - Momentum indicator should be positive

- **Exit Point**: 14x
  - 65% gain from entry
  - In high-risk territory but before extreme danger
  - Takes advantage of increased volatility

  - 17.6% loss from entry
  - Exits position before volatility becomes too low
  - Risk-reward ratio of approximately 1:3.7

- **Expected Success Rate**: ~55%
  - Lower than Strategy 1 due to increased rug probability
  - Higher potential reward compensates for lower success rate

## Risk Management Guidelines

1. **Position Sizing**
   - Low Risk Zone: Up to 50% of bankroll
   - Balanced Zone: 25-30% of bankroll
   - Growth Zone: 15-20% of bankroll
   - High Risk Zone: Max 10% of bankroll
   - Danger Zone: Max 5% of bankroll
   - Extreme Zone: 0% (exit only)

2. **Stop Loss Discipline**
   - Always set stop losses when entering
   - Base stop loss percentage on the zone's volatility
   - Never move stop losses lower once set

3. **Take Profit Levels**
   - Low Risk Zone: 25-50% gain
   - Balanced Zone: 50-75% gain
   - Growth Zone: 50-100% gain
   - High Risk Zone: 25-50% gain (faster exits)
   - Danger Zone: Any gain (immediate exit)

4. **Tick Timer Awareness**
   - Track approximate tick count when possible
   - Be more cautious after 100+ ticks
   - Consider reducing position size after 200+ ticks
   - Extremely cautious after 500+ ticks

## Advanced Indicators to Watch

1. **Volatility Changes**
   - Sudden increases in candle size signal increased risk
   - Price consolidation (small candles) may indicate coming big move

2. **Price Momentum**
   - Consecutive green candles increase rug probability
   - Look for local dips for safer entries

3. **Price Action Patterns**
   - Double tops often indicate reversal
   - Three consecutive red candles may signal buying opportunity
   - Long wicks show rejection of price levels

4. **Player Behavior**
   - Watch for mass exits (many player icons appearing)
   - VIP players exiting can signal upcoming rug

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Game Variability**: Each game is ultimately controlled by the PRNG
- **Meta-Algorithm Influence**: The meta-layer balancing system can affect these probabilities
- **Experience Factor**: Success rates likely higher for experienced players
- **No Guarantees**: All strategies come with inherent risk of complete loss
- **Psychological Discipline**: Sticking to exit and stop loss points is crucial

## Summary of Sweet Spots
