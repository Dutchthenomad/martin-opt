## 🧮 ANALYSIS FORMULAS

### Basic Player Metrics
```python
# Profit/Loss calculation
profit_loss = sum(proceeds) - sum(costs)

# Trading efficiency  
efficiency = profit_loss / total_volume

# Risk exposure
max_position = max(cumulative_position_by_tick)

# Timing score
entry_timing_score = 1 - (entry_tick / total_game_ticks)
exit_timing_score = (exit_tick - peak_tick) / (total_ticks - peak_tick)
```

### Advanced Player Analytics
```python
# Player concentration index
player_concentration = top_player_volume / total_game_volume

# Trading synchronization
synchronization = correlation(player_trades, price_movements)

# Market impact
market_impact = price_change_after_large_trades / trade_size

# Player retention
retention = players_in_multiple_games / total_unique_players
```

## 🎮 GAME-LEVEL PLAYER ANALYSIS

### Market Dynamics
```python
# Player entry/exit waves
entry_distribution = trades_by_tick['buy']
exit_distribution = trades_by_tick['sell']

# Panic selling detection
panic_threshold = price_drop > 0.2
panic_sellers = players_selling_during_panic

# Diamond hands identification  
diamond_hands = players_not_selling_at_peak

# Whale impact analysis
whale_trades = trades_above_threshold
whale_market_impact = price_movement_correlation
```

### Social Trading Patterns
```python
# Follow-the-leader behavior
leader_trades = largest_volume_player_trades
follower_trades = similar_timing_smaller_trades

# Herd mentality detection
herd_buying = synchronized_buy_orders
herd_selling = synchronized_sell_orders

# Contrarian trading
contrarians = players_trading_opposite_to_crowd
```
